Based on the provided contexts, there is no direct information on writing a program to calculate the working hours of a dentist. However, the contexts do provide some related information on dentists and their working hours.

From the Indeed article [source](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/working-hours-of-a-dentist), dentists typically work full-time hours during a standard business week, and some dentists provide emergency services as needed. However, dentists often have a lot of flexibility when establishing the hours they work.

The question seems to be more related to the programming context, which discusses calculating overtime pay for employees. The Easter Science example [source](https://www.easterscience.com/q1-write-a-program-to-calculate-overtime-pay-of-10-employees-overtime-is-paid-at-the-rate-of-rs-12-00-per-hour-for-every-hour-worked-above-40-hours-assume-that-employees-do-not-work-for-fractional/) provides a Python program that calculates overtime pay for employees.

While this program is not specifically designed for calculating a dentist's working hours, it demonstrates the use of programming to handle employee hours and overtime pay. You could potentially adapt this code to suit your needs in calculating a dentist's working hours, including overtime pay if applicable.

Here's a simplified version of the code from Easter Science:

```python
# Initialize variables
employee_hours = 0
overtime_pay = 0

# Prompt user for working hours
employee_hours = float(input("Enter the working hours: "))

# Calculate overtime pay if applicable
if employee_hours > 40:
    overtime_hours = employee_hours - 40
    overtime_pay = overtime_hours * 12.00
    employee_hours = 40

# Calculate total pay
total_pay = (employee_hours * 12.00) + overtime_pay

# Display results
print("Total pay: $", total_pay)
```

Remember to adapt this code to suit your specific requirements for calculating a dentist's working hours.
